The school was founded in 1885 as the Georgia School of Technology as part of Reconstruction plans to build an industrial economy in the post-Civil War Southern United States. Initially, it offered only a degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, its curriculum had expanded to include electrical, civil, and chemical engineering. In 1948, the school changed its name to reflect its evolution from a trade school to a larger and more capable technical institute and research university. Today, Georgia Tech is organized into six colleges and contains about 31 departments/units, with emphasis on science and technology. It is well recognized for its degree programs in computer science and engineering.[11]","As a research-oriented degree, the Ph.D. in Computer Science prepares exceptional students for careers at the cutting edge of academia, industry and government. Students are expected to demonstrate excellence in both defining and executing a substantial research project that forms a novel contribution to the state of the art in computing. With a highly individualized program of study, the degree provides students with depth in their chosen research area coupled with a rigorous breadth of knowledge across the discipline.",https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/faculty?field_person_school_target_id%5B204%5D=204,Mustaque Ahamad (mustaque.ahamad@cc.gatech.edu); Mostaga Ammar (ammar@cc.gatech.edu); Thomas Conte (conte@cc.gatech.edu); Richard Demillo (rad@gatech.edu); Merrick Furst (merrick.furst@cc.gatech.edu),https://lv7ms1pq6dm2sea8j1mrajzw-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GT-1200x675.jpg

Founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the College of New Jersey, Princeton is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[9][10][a] The institution moved to Newark in 1747, and then to the current site nine years later. It officially became a university in 1896 and was subsequently renamed Princeton University.","Machine learning and computational perception research at Princeton is focused on the theoretical foundations of machine learning, the experimental study of machine learning algorithms, and the interdisciplinary application of machine learning to other domains, such as biology and information retrieval. Some of the techniques that we are studying include boosting, probabilistic graphical models, support-vector machines, and nonparametric Bayesian techniques. We are especially interested in learning from large and complex data sets. Example applications include habitat modeling of species distributions, topic models of large collections of scientific articles, classification of brain images, protein function classification, and extensions of the Wordnet semantic network.",https://www.cs.princeton.edu/research/areas/mlearn,Ryan Adams (rpa@cs.princeton.edu); Sanjeev Arora (arora@cs.princeton.edu); Danqi Chen (danqic@cs.princeton.edu); Jia Deng (jiadeng@cs.princeton.edu); Barbara Engelhardt (bee@cs.princeton.edu); Tom Griffiths (tomg@cs.princeton.edu); Elad Hazan (ehazan@cs.princeton.edu); Karthik Narasimhan (karthikn@cs.princeton.edu); Olga Russakovsky (olgarus@cs.princeton.edu; Sebastian Seung (sseung@cs.princeton.edu),https://www.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale_1440/public/images/2020/06/20170816_CL_DJA_152%281%29.jpg?itok=va4lLG5S
