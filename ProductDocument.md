### Product Overview

This shiny app was made with the intention of acting as a tool to browse through grad school programs. Users can filter a list of grad school programs by their location, area of study, length, price and other values. We decided to develop this app because of the difficulty that exists in getting information from different grad schools.



### Product Objectives

The objective of this project is to make finding information about grad schools easier. This is done by compiling the most important information about a school into one spot in a standardized format. If the user finds a program particularly interesting they can then head to the schools website to learn more. The job of the app is to simply filter out programs the user would not be interested in.

### Product Feature / Program Filter

The Program Filter is the main tool for filtering out unwanted programs. Only want to look at schools in New England? Select that and deselect the rest. Only interested in PhD programs? Filter out the others. The rest of the app will react accordingly to the choices you make here. Once you have filtered through the list of programs to diminish the list to a more usable size you can then look at some of their quick facts.



### Product Feature / Program List

The Program list is where you will find the quick facts for each program. Here you can see each program's field of study, whether its a PhD or Masters program, where it is, the tuition cost, application fee, deadlines, and program link. Each of these fields can be used to sort the list giving you the option to only look at the cheapest options or the shortest programs. You can also search for key words in any of the fields, allowing you to look up directly a specific field value.



### Product Feature / Program Map

Once the user has found a suitable program, they can then locate that program on the Program Map. This will give them a better idea of where the program is located relative to where they live and other programs they're interested in. Here they can hover over each program to see the same quick facts about each school. If they want to learn more about a particular program they can click on the point which will open up the Detail view of that program.

The detailed view of the program will provide further detail about the program.
